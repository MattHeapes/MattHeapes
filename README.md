- 👋 Hi, I’m @MattHeapes or just Matt! 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... I've recently picked up a few new hobbies actually. One is photography. I've always loved photography, but I recently went to Rocky Mountain National Park for the first time since I was a kid, and I wanted to take some good photos this time. I also can't resist some Minecraft! Other lifetime hobbies include Camping, Hiking and Fishing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...Vue.js, TypeScript 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything! Currently working to convert my 3d printer over to the Klipper firmware.
