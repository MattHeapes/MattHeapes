- 👋 Hi, I’m @MattHeapes or just Matt! 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... I've recently picked up a few new hobbies actually. One is photography. I've always loved photography, but I recently went to Rocky Mountain National Park for the first time since I was a kid, and I wanted to take some good photos this time. I ended up with a Sony A7III and alot of great photos of the mountains.  My nieces and nephew have become the new stars of the show since then. The other hobby I've rediscoved is Video games. I recently built myself a new computer and I've been playing through Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Cyberpunk 2077, and of course, I cant resist some Minecraft! Other lifetime hobbies include Camping, Hiking and Fishing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Java, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MVC ASP.NET
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything, coding is life right now! 
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can reach me at mtheapes@gmail.com.
