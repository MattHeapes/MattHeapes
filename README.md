- 👋 Hi, I’m @MattHeapes or just Matt! 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... I've recently picked up a few new hobbies actually. One is a very old hobby that I havn't done anything with since i was 12 or 13, and that's Warhammer 40k. I know super nerdy, can't help it. The other hobby I've rediscoved is Video games. I recently built myself a new computer and I've been playing through Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Cyberpunk 2077, and of course, I cant resist some Minecraft! Less nerdy hobbies include Camping, Hiking and Fishing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Java, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MVC ASP.NET
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything, coding is life right now! 
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can reach me at mtheapes@gmail.com.
